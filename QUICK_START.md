# Quick Start Guide

Welcome! This guide will help you deploy the OXH AI demo to HuggingFace Spaces in just 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- HuggingFace account (create free at [huggingface.co/join](https://huggingface.co/join))
- 3 files ready: `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, `README.md`

## Local Testing (Optional)

If you want to test locally before deploying:

```bash
cd huggingface-demos/oxher-demo

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app locally
python app.py
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:7860`

**Note:** Local testing is optional. You can deploy directly to HuggingFace without testing locally.

## Deploy to HuggingFace (Recommended Method)

### Web UI Deploy - Step by Step

#### Step 1: Create Space (1 minute)
1. Go to [huggingface.co/new-space](https://huggingface.co/new-space)
2. Log in if needed
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Space name:** `oxher-demo` or `oxh-ai-demo` (lowercase, no spaces)
   - **License:** MIT
   - **SDK:** Gradio (select from dropdown)
   - **Hardware:** CPU - Free (sufficient for this demo)
   - **Visibility:** Public (recommended for maximum reach)
4. Click **"Create Space"**

#### Step 2: Upload Files (1 minute)

Upload these 3 files **in this order**:

1. **First:** `README.md`
   - Contains Space metadata (title, SDK version, etc.)
   - HuggingFace reads this for configuration
   - Drag & drop or click "Add file"

2. **Second:** `requirements.txt`
   - Python dependencies list
   - HuggingFace auto-installs these packages

3. **Third:** `app.py`
   - Main application code
   - 641 lines, 6 functional tabs

**Important:** Upload README.md first! It contains Space configuration metadata.

#### Step 3: Wait for Build (2-3 minutes)

HuggingFace automatically:
- Detects Gradio SDK
- Creates Python environment
- Installs requirements.txt packages
- Launches app.py
- Exposes public URL

**Watch build progress:**
- Green checkmark = Success
- Red X = Build failed (check logs)
- Orange spinner = Building...

#### Step 4: Test Your Demo (2 minutes)

Once deployed, test all features:

1. **Signal Generator**
   - Symbol: BTCUSDT
   - Timeframe: 1h
   - Click "Generate Signal"
   - Should see: Direction, Confidence, Entry/Exit levels

2. **Vision Analysis**
   - Upload any chart screenshot (TradingView, Binance, etc.)
   - Click "Analyze Chart"
   - Should see: Patterns, Support/Resistance, Recommendations

3. **Technical Indicators**
   - Symbol: ETHUSDT
   - Timeframe: 4h
   - Click "Get Indicators"
   - Should see: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.

4. **Bulk Scanner**
   - Symbols: BTCUSDT,ETHUSDT,BNBUSDT
   - Timeframes: 1h,4h
   - Click "Scan Symbols"
   - Should see: Table with ranked opportunities

5. **News Feed**
   - Click "Load Latest News"
   - Should see: Recent crypto news articles

6. **Price Checker**
   - Symbol: BTCUSDT
   - Click "Check Price"
   - Should see: Current price

**All tabs should show real, live data!**

#### Step 5: Share Your Demo

Your Space is now live at:
```

Title: Built an AI Trading Signals Platform - Live Demo on HuggingFace

We've been building OXH AI, an AI-powered crypto trading signals platform, and just launched a live demo on HuggingFace.

Features:
- Real-time signal generation
- AI vision analysis for chart screenshots
- 50+ technical indicators
- Multi-symbol bulk scanner
- Live news feed

This uses our production API with real market data - not simulated.

Key differentiator: We're a signal platform, not an exchange. You trade on your own accounts. We never hold funds or require API key access.

Would love feedback from the community!
